# Exotik - E-commerce Website for Perfumes

Welcome to Exotik, an e-commerce website for perfumes. This project is built using Symfony and requires certain dependencies and configurations to be set up locally. Follow the steps below to get the project up and running on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **WampServer**: To manage your web server and databases.
- **PHP**: Version 7.4 or higher.
- **Composer**: Dependency Manager for PHP.
- **Symfony CLI**: For running Symfony commands.

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, clone the project repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/exotik.git
cd exotik
```
### Step 2: Set Up WampServer
- Install WampServer.
- Start WampServer and ensure all services are running.
- Access phpMyAdmin via http://localhost/phpmyadmin.

### Step 3: Import the Database
- In phpMyAdmin, create a new database named exotik.
- Import the SQL file located in the project root directory:

```bash
cd exotik
```
Navigate to exotik.sql in phpMyAdmin and import it into the exotik database.

### Step 4: Install PHP Dependencies
